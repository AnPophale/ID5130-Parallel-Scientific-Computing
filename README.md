### Parallel implementation of the Multigrid method

This project was part of the course ID5130 Parallel Scientific Computing taken during the Jan-May 2024 semester. The main objective of this work is to parallelize the multigrid method using OpenMP for shared memory systems and MPI for distributed memory systems. Further, the performance of standard iterative solvers such as the Jacobi and Gauss Seidel Methods is compared with the Multigrid method along with parallel implementations of both
